                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>400 g of Powdered Milk</li>
                        <li>2 Cups of Chocolate Powder 50% Cocoa (240 ml Cup)</li>
                        <li>100 g of Instant Coffee</li>
                        <li>1 Tablespoon of Baking Soda</li>
                        <li>1 Teaspoon of Cinnamon Powde</li>
                        <li>(To Serve)100 ml of Hot Milk or Water</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Modo de Fazer (How to Make)</h3>
                   <P>Start by adding the powdered milk in a food processor. If you don't have a processor at home, you can make this recipe in a blender, and it will work out just fine.
Add the chocolate powder and the instant coffee. We used extra strong coffee, but if you like a milder taste, use a little less.
Add the baking soda, the cinnamon powder, but cinnamon is optional, and beat everything very well until combined.
Next, transfer to a jar that has an airtight lid to seal it well and preserve the flavor of the recipe.
Now, to serve, add 3 teaspoons of the cappuccino powder in very hot milk and mix. And if you like a milder flavor, you can replace the milk with very hot water. Serve.</P>
